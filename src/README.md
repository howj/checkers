# Information

Players interact with the board by clicking pieces, then spaces to move to, on their turn. Upon clicking a piece, the clicked piece is highlighted, and available spots they can move the piece to are also highlighted. A player ends their turn after making their move/when they have no more jumps possible. King pieces have a black outline around them. The game ends when the current player has no more moves they can make, or after making a move, they are left with no more moves.
